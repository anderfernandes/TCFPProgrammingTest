# TCFP Programming Test (.NET 6 MVC)

## About

This project consists of a MVC application that will help us evaluate your skills in building applications with
the MVC archteture and using the C# programming language.

One of the most important things we do at the Texas Commission of Fire Protection is to track how firefighters
get injured at the line of duty. In order to make their jobs safer, we look at this data to see how we
can prevent them from happening.

## Injury Reports

The code in this repository consists of a .NET 6 MVC application that manipulates injury report data: create, read, update, delete them.

The HomeController contains a list of departments and a list of reports. Below them there are routes that manipulate the reports.

Your job is to add code to each route that does what we need them to do. Look for `TODO` comments as they have information on what they must be doing.

Good luck!

## Get Started

This project was created with Visual Studio 2022 in mind. The Community version is free.

Once you have it installed, open this project with it and you should be good to go.

## Running the project

When you run the project in Visual Studio 2022, a new browser window will open with the application for you to use it. 
Hot Reload is built in to improve your DX.

## Evaluation

The first criteria for evaluation will be if the application does what its supposed to do without any bugs: create, read, update, delete
injury reports.

The second criteria will be both code quality and UI/UX.
